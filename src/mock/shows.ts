For botching the murder, Hagen's supply is cut off, and when he breaks into Daggett's lab for more Renuyu, he pays the price dearly when Daggett's men drench his face in the formula and force him to swallow liters of it to avoid drowning. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is arrested and taken into custody, charged with the assault on Fox.</p>",

      summary:
        "<p><b>The New Batman Adventures</b> comes from the creators of Batman and Superman. This series was created because Fox had not lived up to the contract that they had given Batman, so the WB decided to give the show another chance. Bruce Timm then went back and decided to re-design all of the characters from Batman and ended up revamping the series all-together.</p>",
